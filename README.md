# retroid-classic-overlays

Hi, this are some very basic overlays I made for the Retroid Pocket Classic. Make sure to turn off Auto-Scale Overlay.

# GameBoy Advance
This includes borders, as well as a basic grid effect. The grid is taken from /u/1playerinsertcoin's GBA Miyoo Mini overlay, just scaled up to fit the RP Classic screen.

Integer Scaling: ON
Overlay Opacity: .8
Scaling: Core Provided

# PS1

Integer Scaling: ON
Overlay Opacity: 1
Scaling: 4:3
